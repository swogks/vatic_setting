# VATIC_setting

All kinds of side-product produced during works


1. VATIC(Video Annotation Tool from Irvine, California) installation guide (working in ubuntu 14.04 64bit) 16.07.29 successfully works.
   
   This guidance only covers a local mode, not with Amazon mechanical turk. I made this guide because any of tutorial doesn't work recently (even official one)

  1. 'vatic_installation_park.sh' is a true shell script, you can free with executing directly in terminal.
  2. 'additional_instruction.sh' is not a shell script, just follow its guidance.
  3. 'execution_instruction.txt' is a sample execution instruction.
